Introduction
------------

The GNU toolchain is increasingly being used for deeply embedded
software development. This type of software development is also called
standalone C programming and bare metal C programming. Standalone C
programming brings along with it new problems, and dealing with them
requires a deeper understanding of the GNU toolchain. The GNU
toolchain's manuals provide excellent information on the toolchain,
but from the perspective of the toolchain, rather than the perspective
of the problem. Well, that is how manuals are supposed to be written
anyway. The result is that the answers to common problems are
scattered all over, and new users of the GNU toolchain are left
baffled.

This tutorial attempts to bridge the gap by explaining the tools from
the perspective of the problem. Hopefully, this should enable more
people to use the GNU toolchain for their embedded projects.

For the purpose of this tutorial, an ARM based embedded system is
emulated using Qemu. With this you can learn the GNU toolchain from
the comforts of your desktop, without having to invest on
hardware. This tutorial itself does not teach the ARM instruction
set. It is supposed to be used with other books and on-line tutorials
like:

  * ARM Assembler - http://www.heyrick.co.uk/assembler/
  * ARM Assembly Language Programming - http://www.arm.com/miscPDFs/9658.pdf

But for the convenience of the reader, frequently used ARM
instructions are listed in the appendix.

[[arm-lab]]
Setting up the ARM Lab
----------------------

This section shows how to setup a simple ARM development and testing
environment in your PC, using Qemu and the GNU toolchain. Qemu is a
machine emulator capable of emulating various machines including ARM
based machines. You can write ARM assembly programs, compile them
using the GNU toolchain and execute and test them in Qemu.

Qemu ARM
~~~~~~~~

Qemu will be used to emulate a PXA255 based 'connex' board from
Gumstix. You should have at least version 0.9.1 of Qemu to work with
this tutorial.

The PXA255 has an ARM core with a ARMv5TE compliant instruction
set. The PXA255 also has several on-chip peripherals. Some peripherals
will be introduced in the course of the tutorial.

Installing Qemu in Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Debian Etch has a `qemu` package, but the version is 0.8.2, which does
not have the connex board emulation. Debian Etch backports has version
0.9.1 of qemu. To install from backports:

  1. Add the following line to `/etc/apt/source.list`
+
------
deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib non-free
------
+
  2. Add the archive's key to `apt`.
+
------
$ wget -O - http://backports.org/debian/archive.key | apt-key add -
------
+
  3. Run `apt-get update`.
  4. Install `qemu` from backports
+
------
$ apt-get -t etch-backports install qemu
------

Installing GNU Toolchain for ARM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Folks at CodeSourcery (part of Mentor Graphics) have been kind enough to make GNU
     toolchains available for various architectures. Download the GNU
     toolchain for ARM, available from from
     http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/
+
  2. Extract the tar archive, to `~/toolchains`.
+
------
$ mkdir ~/toolchains
$ cd ~/toolchains
$ tar -jxf ~/downloads/arm-2008q1-126-arm-none-eabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2 
------
+
  3. Add the toolchain to your `PATH`.
+
------
$ PATH=$HOME/toolchains/arm-2008q1/bin:$PATH
------
+
  4. You might want to add the previous line to your `.bashrc`.

[[hello-arm]]
Hello ARM
---------

In this section, you will learn to assemble a simple ARM program, and
test it on a bare metal connex board emulated by Qemu.

The assembly program source file consists of a sequence of statements,
one per line. Each statement has the following format.

------
label:    instruction         @ comment
------

Each of the components is optional. 

`label`::
The label is a convenient way to refer to the location of the
instruction in memory. The label can be used where ever an address can
appear, for example as an operand of branch instruction. The label
name should consist of alphabets, digits, `_` and `$`.

`comment`::
A comment starts with an `@`, and the characters that appear after an
`@` are ignored.

`instruction`::
The `instruction` could be an ARM instruction or an assembler
directive. Assembler directives are commands to the
assembler. Assembler directives always start with a `.` (period).

Here is a very simple ARM assembly program to add two numbers.

[[add]]
.Adding Two Numbers
[lang="armasm"]
------
	.text                
start:                       @ Label, not really required
	mov   r0, #5	     @ Load register r0 with the value 5
	mov   r1, #4	     @ Load register r1 with the value 4
	add   r2, r1, r0     @ Add r0 and r1 and store in r2
	
stop:	b stop               @ Infinite loop to stop execution
------

The `.text` is an assembler directive, which says that the following
instructions have to be assembled into the code section, rather than
the `.data` section. Sections will be covered in detail, later in the
tutorial.

Building the Binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save the program in a file say `add.s`. To assemble the file, invoke
the GNU Toolchain's assembler `as`, as shown in the following command.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-as -o add.o add.s
------

The `-o` option specifies the output filename. 

NOTE: Cross toolchains are always prefixed with the target
architecture for which they are built, to avoid name conflicts with
the host toolchain. For the sake readability, tools will be referred
to without the prefix, in the text.

To generate the executable file, invoke the GNU Toolchain's linker
`ld`, as shown in the following command.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-ld -Ttext=0x0 -o add.elf add.o
------

Here again, the `-o` option specifies the output filename. The
`-Ttext=0x0`, specifies that addresses should be assigned to the
labels, such that the instructions were starting from address
`0x0`. To view the address assignment for various labels, the `nm`
command can be used as shown below.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-nm add.elf
... clip ...
00000000 t start
0000000c t stop
------

Note the address assignment for the labels `start` and `stop`. The
address assigned for `start` is `0x0`. Since it is the label of the
first instruction. The label `stop` is after 3 instructions. Each
instructions is 4 bytes. Hence `stop` is assigned an address `12`
(`0xC`).

Linking with a different base address for the instructions will result
in a different set of addresses being assigned to the labels.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-ld -Ttext=0x20000000 -o add.elf add.o
$ arm-none-eabi-nm add.elf
... clip ...
20000000 t start
2000000c t stop
------

The output file created by `ld` is in a format called `ELF`. Various
file formats are available for storing executable code. The ELF format
works fine when you have an OS around, but since we are going to run
the program on bare metal, we will have to convert it to a simpler
file format called the `binary` format.

A file in `binary` format contains consecutive bytes from a specific
memory address. No other additional information is stored in the
file. This is convenient for Flash programming tools, since all that
has to be done when programming is to copy each byte in the file, to
consecutive address starting from a specified base address in memory.

The GNU toolchain's `objcopy` command can be used to convert between
different object file formats. A common usage of the command is given
below.

------
objcopy -O <output-format> <in-file> <out-file>
------

To convert `add.elf` to binary format the following command can be
used.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary add.elf add.bin
------

Check the size of the file. The file will be exactly 16 bytes. Since
there are 4 instructions and each instruction occupies 4 bytes.

------
$ ls -al add.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 vijaykumar vijaykumar 16 2008-10-03 23:56 add.bin
------

Executing in Qemu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the ARM processor is reset, it starts executing from address
`0x0`. On the connex board a 16MB Flash is located at address
`0x0`. The instructions present in the beginning of the Flash will be
executed.

When `qemu` emulates the connex board, a file has to be specified
which will be treated file as Flash memory. The Flash file format is
very simple. To get the byte from address X in the Flash, `qemu` reads
the byte from offset X in the file. In fact, this is the same as the
binary file format.

To test the program, on the emulated Gumstix connex board, we first
create a 16MB file representing the Flash. We use the `dd` command to
copy 16MB of zeroes from `/dev/zero` to the file `flash.bin`. The data
is copied in 4K blocks.

------
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=flash.bin bs=4096 count=4096
------

`add.bin` file is then copied into the beginning of the Flash, using
the following command.

------
$ dd if=add.bin of=flash.bin bs=4096 conv=notrunc
------

This is the equivalent of programming the `bin` file on to the Flash
memory.

After reset, the processor will start executing from address `0x0`,
and the instructions from the program will get executed. The command
to invoke `qemu` is given below.

------
$ qemu-system-arm -M connex -pflash flash.bin -nographic -serial /dev/null
------

The `-M connex` option specifies that the machine `connex` is to be
emulated. The `-pflash` options specifies that `flash.bin` file
represents the Flash memory. The `-nographic` specifies that
simulation of a graphical display is not required. The `-serial
/dev/null` specifies that the serial port of the connex board is to be
connected to `/dev/null`, so that the serial port data is discarded.

The system executes the instructions and after completion, keeps
looping infinitely in the `stop: b stop` instruction. To view the
contents of the registers, the monitor interface of `qemu` can be
used. The monitor interface is a command line interface, through which
the emulated system can be controlled and the status of the system can
be viewed. When `qemu` is started with the above mentioned command,
the monitor interface is provided in the standard I/O of `qemu`.

To view the contents of the registers the `info registers` monitor
command can be used.

------
(qemu) info registers
R00=00000005 R01=00000004 R02=00000009 R03=00000000
R04=00000000 R05=00000000 R06=00000000 R07=00000000
R08=00000000 R09=00000000 R10=00000000 R11=00000000
R12=00000000 R13=00000000 R14=00000000 R15=0000000c
PSR=400001d3 -Z-- A svc32
------

Note the value in register `R02`. The register contains the result of
the addition and should match with the expected value of 9.

More Monitor Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some useful `qemu` monitor commands are listed in the following table.

`-----------------`-------------------------------
Command           Purpose
--------------------------------------------------
`help`		  List available commands
`quit`		  Quits the emulator
`xp /fmt addr`	  Physical memory dump from `addr`
`system_reset`    Reset the system.
--------------------------------------------------

The `xp` command deserves more explanation. The `fmt` argument
specifies how the memory contents is to be displayed. The syntax of
`fmt` is `<count><format><size>`.

`count`::
specifies no. of data items to be dumped.

`size`::
specifies the size of each data item. `b` for 8 bits, `h` for 16 bits,
`w` for 32 bits and `g` for 64 bits.

`format`::
specifies the display format. `x` for hex, `d` for signed decimal, `u`
for unsigned decimal, `o` for octal, `c` for char and `i` for
asm instructions.

This `xp` command with the `i` format, can be used to disassemble the
instructions present in memory. To disassemble the instructions
located at `0x0`, the `xp` command the `fmt` specified as `4iw` can be
used. The `4` specifies 4 items are to be displayed, `i` specifies
that the items are to be printed as instructions (yes, a built in
disassembler!), `w` specifies that the items are 32 bits in size. The
output of the command is shown below.

------
(qemu) xp /4iw 0x0
0x00000000:  mov        r0, #5  ; 0x5
0x00000004:  mov        r1, #4  ; 0x4
0x00000008:  add        r2, r1, r0
0x0000000c:  b  0xc
------

[[asm-directives]]
More Assembler Directives
-------------------------

In this section, we will describe some commonly used assembler
directives, using two example programs.

  1. A program to sum an array
  2. A program to calculate the length of a string

Sum an Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code sums an array of bytes and stores the result in
`r3`.

.Sum an Array
[lang="armasm"]
------
include::code/sum.s[]
------

The code introduces two new assembler directives -- `.byte` and
`.align`. These assembler directives are described below.

`.byte` Directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The byte sized arguments of `.byte` are assembled into consecutive
bytes in memory. There are similar directives `.2byte` and `.4byte`
for storing 16 bit values and 32 bit values, respectively. The general
syntax is given below.

------
.byte   exp1, exp2, ...
.2byte  exp1, exp2, ...
.4byte  exp1, exp2, ...
------

The arguments could be simple integer literal, represented as binary
(prefixed by `0b` or `0B`), octal (prefixed by `0`), decimal or
hexadecimal (prefixed by `0x` or `0X`). The integers could also be
represented as character constants (character surrounded by single
quotes), in which case the ASCII value of the character will be used.

The arguments could also be C expressions constructed out of literals
and other symbols. Examples are shown below.

------
pattern:  .byte 0b01010101, 0b00110011, 0b00001111
npattern: .byte npattern - pattern
halpha:   .byte 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'
dummy:    .4byte 0xDEADBEEF
nalpha:   .byte 'Z' - 'A' + 1
------

`.align` Directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ARM requires that the instructions be present in 32-bit aligned memory
locations. The address of the first byte, of the 4 bytes in an
instruction, should be a multiple of 4. To adhere to this, the
`.align` directive can be used to insert padding bytes till the next
byte address will be a multiple of 4. This is required only when data
bytes or half words are inserted within code.

String Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code calculates the length of string and stores the
length in register `r1`.

.String Length
[lang="armasm"]
------
include::code/strlen.s[]
------

The code introduces two new assembler directives - `.asciz` and
`.equ`. The assembler directives are described below.

`.asciz` Directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `.asciz` directive accepts string literals as arguments. String
literal are a sequence characters in double quotes. The string
literals are assembled into consecutive memory locations. The
assembler automatically inserts a `nul` character ('\0' character)
after each string.

The `.ascii` directive is same as `.asciz`, but the assembler does not
insert a `nul` character after each string.

`.equ` Directive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The assembler maintains something called a symbol table. The symbol
table maps label names to an addresses. Whenever the assembler
encounters a label definition, the assembler makes an entry in the
symbol table. And whenever the assembler encounters a label reference,
it replaces the label by the corresponding address from the symbol
table.

Using the assembler directive `.equ`, it is also possible to manually
insert entries in the symbol table, to map names to values, which are
not necessarily addresses. Whenever the assembler encounters these
names, it replaces them by their corresponding values. These names and
label names are together called symbol names.

The general syntax of the directive is given below.

------
.equ name, expression
------

The `name` is a symbol name, and has the same restrictions as that of
the label name. The `expression` could be simple literal, or an
expression as explained for the `.byte` directive.

NOTE: Unlike the `.byte` directive, the `.equ` directive itself does
not allocate any memory. They just create entries in the symbol
table. 

[[using-ram]]
Using RAM
---------

The Flash memory, in which the previous example programs were stored,
is a kind of EEPROM. It is a useful secondary storage, like a hard
disk, but is not convenient to store variables in Flash. The variables
should be stored in RAM, so that they can be easily modified.

The connex board has a 64 MB of RAM starting at address `0xA0000000`,
in which variables can be stored. The memory map of the connex board
can be pictured as shown in the following diagram.

.Memory Map
image::flash-ram-mm.png[Memory Map]

Necessary setup has to be done to place the variables at this
address. To understand what has to be done, the role of assembler and
linker has to be understood.

[[linker]]
Linker
------

While writing a multi-file program, each file is assembled individually
into object files. The linker combines these object files to form the
final executable.

.Role of the Linker
image::linker.png[Role of the Linker]

While combining the object files together, the linker performs the
following operations.

  1. Symbol Resolution
  2. Relocation

We will look into these operations, in detail, in this section.

Symbol Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a single file program, while producing the object file, all
references to labels are replaced by their corresponding addresses by
the assembler. But in a multi-file program, if there are any
references to labels defined in another file, the assembler marks
these references as "unresolved". When these object files are passed
to the linker, the linker determines the values for these references
from the other object files, and patches the code with the correct
values.

The sum of array example is split into two files, to demonstrate the
symbol resolution performed by the linker. The two files will be
assembled and their symbol tables examined to show the presence the
unresolved references.

The file `sum-sub.s` contains the `sum` subroutine, and the file
`main.s` invokes the subroutine with the required arguments. The
source of the files is shown below.

[[l1]]
.`main.s` - Subroutine Invocation
[lang="armasm"]
------
include::code/main.s[]
------

[[l2]]
.`sum-sub.s` - Subroutine Definition
[lang="armasm"]
------
include::code/sum-sub.s[]
------

A word on the `.global` directive is in order. In C, all variables
declared outside functions are visible to other files, until
explicitly stated as `static`. In assembly, all labels are `static`
AKA local (to the file), until explicitly stated that they should be
visible to other files, using the `.global` directive.

The files are assembled, and the symbol tables are dumped using the
`nm` command.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-as -o main.o main.s
$ arm-none-eabi-as -o sum-sub.o sum-sub.s
$ arm-none-eabi-nm main.o
00000004 t arr
00000007 t eoa
00000008 t start
00000018 t stop
         U sum 
$ arm-none-eabi-nm sum-sub.o
00000004 t loop
00000000 T sum
------

For now, focus on the letter in the second column, which specifies the
symbol type.  A `t` indicates that the symbol is defined, in the text
section. A `u` indicates that the symbol is undefined. A letter in
uppercase indicates that the symbol is `.global`.

It is evident that the symbol `sum` is defined in `sum-sub.o` and is
not resolved yet in `main.o`. When the linker is invoked the symbol
references will be resolved, and the executable will be produced. 

Relocation
~~~~~~~~~~

Relocation is the process of changing addresses already assigned to
labels. This will also involve patching up all label references to
reflect the newly assigned address. Primarily, relocation is performed
for the following two reasons:

  1. Section Merging
  2. Section Placement

To understand the process of relocation, an understanding of the
concept of sections is essential. 

Code and data have different run time requirements. For example code
can be placed in read-only memory, and data might require read-write
memory. It would be convenient, if code and data is *not*
interleaved. For this purpose, programs are divided into
sections. Most programs have at least two sections, `.text` for code
and `.data` for data. Assembler directives `.text` and `.data`, are
used to switch back and forth between the two sections.

It helps to imagine each section as a bucket. When the assembler hits
a section directive, it puts the code/data following the directive in
the selected bucket. Thus the code/data that belong to particular
section appear in contiguous locations. The following figures shows
how the assembler re-arranges data into sections.

.Sections
image::sections.png[Sections]

Now that we have an understanding of sections, let us look into the
primary reasons for which relocation is performed.

Section Merging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When dealing with multi-file programs, the sections with the same name
(example `.text`) might appear, in each file. The linker is
responsible for merging the sections from the input files, into
sections of the output file. By default, the sections, with the same
name, from each file is placed contiguously and the label references
are patched to reflect the new address.

The effects of section merging can be seen by looking at the symbol
table of the object files and the corresponding executable file. The
multi-file sum of array program can be used to illustrate section
merging. The symbol table of the object files `main.o` and `sum-sub.o`
and the symbol table of the executable file `sum.elf` is shown below.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-nm main.o
00000004 t arr
00000007 t eoa
00000008 t start
00000018 t stop
         U sum 
$ arm-none-eabi-nm sum-sub.o
00000004 t loop <1>
00000000 T sum
$ arm-none-eabi-ld -Ttext=0x0 -o sum.elf main.o sum-sub.o
$ arm-none-eabi-nm sum.elf
...
00000004 t arr
00000007 t eoa
00000008 t start
00000018 t stop
00000028 t loop <1>
00000024 T sum
------

<1> The `loop` symbol has address `0x4` in `sum-sub.o`, and `0x28` in
`sum.elf`, since the `.text` section of `sum-sub.o` is placed right
after the `.text` section of `main.o`.

Section Placement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a program is assembled, each section is assumed to start from
address 0. And thus labels are assigned values relative to start of
the section. When the final executable is created, the section is
placed at some address X. And all references to the labels defined
within the section, are incremented by X, so that they point to the
new location.

The placement of each section at a particular location in memory and
the patching of all references to the labels in the section, is done
by the linker.

The effects of section placement can be seen by looking at the symbol
table of the object file and the corresponding executable file. The
single file sum of array program can be used to illustrate section
placement. To make things clearer, we will place the `.text` section
at address `0x100`.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-as -o sum.o sum.s
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n sum.o
00000000 t entry <1>
00000004 t arr
00000007 t eoa
00000008 t start
00000014 t loop
00000024 t stop
$ arm-none-eabi-ld -Ttext=0x100 -o sum.elf sum.o <2>
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n sum.elf
00000100 t entry <3>
00000104 t arr
00000107 t eoa
00000108 t start
00000114 t loop
00000124 t stop
...
------

<1> The address for labels are assigned starting from `0` within a
section. 

<2> When the executable is created the linker is instructed to place
the text section at address `0x100`.

<3> The address for labels in the `.text` section are re-assigned
starting from `0x100`, and all label references will be patched to
reflect this.

The process of section merging and placement is shown in the following
figure.

.Section Merging and Placement
image::relocation.png[Section Merging and Placement]

[[lds]]
Linker Script File
------------------

As mentioned in the previous section, section merging and placement is
done by the linker. The programmer can control how the sections are
merged, and at what locations they are placed in memory through a
linker script file. A very simple linker script file, is shown below.

.Basic linker script
------
SECTIONS { <1>
	. = 0x00000000; <2>
	.text : { <3>
		abc.o (.text); 
		def.o (.text);
	} <3>
}
------

<1> The `SECTIONS` command is the most import linker command, it specifies
how the sections are to be merged and at what location they are to be
placed. 

<2> Within the block following the `SECTIONS` command, the `.`
(period) represents the location counter. The location is always
initialised to `0x0`. It can be modified by assigning a new value to
it. Setting the value to `0x0` at the beginning is superfluous.

<3> This part of the script specifies that, the `.text` section from
the input files `abc.o` and `def.o` should go to the `.text` section
of the output file.

The linker script can be further simplified and generalised by using
the wild card character `*` instead of individually specifying the
file names.

.Wildcard in linker scripts
------
SECTIONS {
	. = 0x00000000;
	.text : { * (.text); }
}
------

If the program contains both `.text` and `.data` sections, the `.data`
section merging and location can be specified as shown below.

[[linker1]]
.Multiple sections in linker scripts
------
include::code/sum-data.lds[]
------

Here, the `.text` section is located at `0x0` and `.data` is located
at `0x400`. Note that, if the location counter is not assigned a
different value, the `.text` and `.data` sections will be located at
adjacent memory locations.

Linker Script Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To demonstrate the use of linker scripts, we will use the linker
script shown in <<linker1>> to control placement a program's `.text`
and `.data` section. We will use a slightly modified version of the
sum of array program for this purpose. The code is shown below.

[lang="armasm"]

The only change here is that the array is now in the `.data`
section. Also note that the nasty branch instruction to skip over the
data is also not required, since the linker script will place the
`.text` section and `.data` section appropriately. As a result,
statements can be placed in the program, in any convenient way, and
the linker script will take care of placing the sections correctly in
memory.

When the program is linked, the linker script is passed as an input to
the linker, as shown in the following command.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-as -o sum-data.o sum-data.s
$ arm-none-eabi-ld -T sum-data.lds -o sum-data.elf sum-data.o
------

The option `-T sum-data.lds` specifies that `sum-data.lds` is to be
used as the linker script. Dumping the symbol table, will provide an
insight into how the sections are placed in memory.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n sum-data.elf
00000000 t start
0000000c t loop
0000001c t stop
00000400 d arr
00000403 d eoa
------

From the symbol table it is obvious that the `.text` is placed
starting from address `0x0` and `.data` section is placed starting
from address `0x400`.

[[data-in-ram]]
Data in RAM, Example
--------------------

Now that we know, how to write linker scripts, we will attempt to
write a program, and place the `.data` section in RAM.

The add program is modified to load two values from RAM, add them and
store the result back to RAM. The two values and the space for result
is placed in the `.data` section.

.Add Data in RAM
[lang="armasm"]
------
include::code/add-mem.s[]
------

When the program is linked, the linker script shown below is used.

------
include::code/flash-ram.lds[]
------

The dump of the symbol table of `.elf` is shown below.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n add-mem.elf
00000000 t start
0000001c t stop
a0000000 d val1
a0000001 d val2
a0000002 d result
------

The linker script seems to have solved the problem of placing the
`.data` section in RAM. But wait, the solution is not complete yet!

RAM is Volatile!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RAM is volatile memory, and hence it is not possible to directly make
the data available in RAM, on power up.

All code and data *should* be stored in Flash before power-up. On
power-up, a startup code is supposed to copy the data from Flash to
RAM, and then proceed with the execution of the program. So the
program's `.data` section has two addresses, a *load address* in Flash
and a *run-time address* in RAM.

TIP: In `ld` parlance, the load address is called LMA (Load Memory
Address), and the run-time address is called VMA (Virtual Memory
Address.).

The following two modifications have to be done, to make the program
work correctly.

  1. The linker script has to be modified to specify the both the load
     address and the run-time address, for the `.data` section.

  2. A small piece of code should copy the `.data` section from Flash
     (load address) to RAM (run-time address).

Specifying Load Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The run-time address is what that should be used for determining the
address of labels. In the previous linker script, we have specified
the run-time address for the `.data` section. The load address is not
explicitly specified, and defaults to the run-time address. This is
OK, with the previous examples, since the programs were executed
directly from Flash. But, if data is to be placed in RAM during
execution, the load address should correspond to Flash and the
run-time address should correspond to RAM.

A load address different from the run-time address can be specified
using the `AT` keyword. The modified linker script is shown below.

------
SECTIONS {
	. = 0x00000000;
	.text : { * (.text); }
	etext = .; <1>

	. = 0xA0000000;
	.data : AT (etext) { * (.data); } <2>
}
------

<1> Symbols can be created on the fly within the `SECTIONS` command by
assigning values to them. Here `etext` is assigned the value of the
location counter at that position. `etext` contains the address of the
next free location in Flash right after all the code. This will be
used later on to specify where the `.data` section is to be placed in
Flash. Note that `etext` itself will not be allocated any memory, it
is just an entry in the symbol table.

<2> The `AT` keyword specifies the load address of the `.data`
section. An address or symbol (whose value is a valid address) could
be passed as argument to `AT`. Here the load address of `.data` is
specified as the location right after all the code in Flash.

Copying `.data` to RAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To copy the data from Flash to RAM, the following information is
required.

  1. Address of data in Flash (`flash_sdata`)
  2. Address of data in RAM (`ram_sdata`)
  3. Size of the `.data` section. (`data_size`)

With this information the data can be copied from Flash to RAM using
the following code snippet.

------
	ldr   r0, =flash_sdata
	ldr   r1, =ram_sdata
	ldr   r2, =data_size

copy:	
	ldrb  r4, [r0], #1
	strb  r4, [r1], #1
	subs  r2, r2, #1
	bne   copy
------

The linker script can be slightly modified to provide these
information.

[[linker2]]
.Linker Script with Section Copy Symbols
------
SECTIONS {
	. = 0x00000000;
	.text : { 
	      * (.text);
	}
	flash_sdata = .; <1>

	. = 0xA0000000;
	ram_sdata = .; <2>
	.data : AT (flash_sdata) { 
              * (.data); 
        };
	ram_edata = .; <3>
	data_size = ram_edata - ram_sdata; <3>
}
------

<1> Start of data in Flash is right after all the code in Flash.

<2> Start of data in RAM is at the base address of RAM.

<3> Obtaining the size of data is not straight forward. The data size
is calculated from the difference in the start of data in RAM and the
end of data in RAM. Yes, simple expressions are allowed within the
linker script.

The add program with data copied to RAM from Flash is listed below.

.Add Data in RAM (with copy)
[lang="armasm"]
------
include::code/add-ram.s[]
------

The program is assembled and linked using the linker script listed in
<<linker2>>. The program is executed and tested within Qemu.

------
qemu-system-arm -M connex -pflash flash.bin -nographic -serial /dev/null
(qemu) xp /4dw 0xA0000000
a0000000:         10         30         40          0
------

NOTE: In a real system with an SDRAM, the memory should not be
accessed right-away. The memory controller will have to be initialised
before performing a memory access. Our code works because the
simulated memory does not require the memory controller to be
initialised.

[[exc-handle]]
Exception Handling
------------------

The examples given so far have a major bug. The first 8 words in the
memory map are reserved for the exception vectors. When an exception
occurs the control is transferred to one these 8 locations. The
exceptions and their exception vector addresses are show in the
following table.

.Exception Vector Addresses
`------------------------`----------------
Exception                Address
------------------------------------------
Reset                    0x00
Undefined Instruction	 0x04
Software Interrupt (SWI) 0x08
Prefetch Abort		 0x0C
Data Abort		 0x10
Reserved, not used	 0x14
IRQ			 0x18
FIQ			 0x1C
---------------------------------------

These locations are supposed to contain a branch that will transfer
control the appropriate exception handler. In the examples we have
seen so far, we haven't inserted branch instructions at the exception
vector addresses. We got away without issues since these exceptions
did not occur. All the above programs can be fixed, by linking them
with the following assembly code.

------
	.section "vectors"
reset:	b     start
undef:  b     undef
swi:	b     swi
pabt:	b     pabt
dabt:	b     dabt
	nop
irq:	b     irq
fiq:	b     fiq
------

Only the reset exception is vectored to a different address
`start`. All other exceptions are vectored to the same address. So if
any exception other that reset occurs, the processor will be spinning
in the same location. The exception can then be identified by looking
at the value of `pc` through a debugger (the monitor interface in our
case).

To ensure that these instruction are placed at the exception vector
addresses, the linker script should look something like below.

------
SECTIONS {
	. = 0x00000000;
	.text : {
		* (vectors);
		* (.text); 
		...
	}
	...
}
------

Notice how the `vectors` section is placed before all other code,
ensuring that the `vectors` is located at address starting from 0x0.

[[c-startup]]
C Startup
---------

It is not possible to directly execute C code, when the processor
comes out of reset. Since, unlike assembly language, C programs need
some basic pre-requisites to be satisfied. This section will describe
the pre-requisites and how to meet the pre-requisites.

We will take the example of C program that calculates the sum of an
array as an example. And by the end of this section, we will be able
to perform the necessary setup, transfer control to the C code and
execute it.

[[csum]]
.Sum of Array in C
[lang="cpp"]
------
include::code/csum.c[]
------

Before transferring control to C code, the following have to be setup
correctly.

  1. Stack
  2. Global variables
     a. Initialized
     b. Uninitialized
  3. Read-only data

Stack
~~~~~

C uses the stack for storing local (auto) variables, passing function
arguments, storing return address, etc. So it is essential that the
stack is setup correctly, before transferring control to C code.

Stacks are highly flexible in the ARM architecture, since the
implementation is completely left to the software. For people not
familiar with the ARM architecture a overview is provided in
<<arm-stacks>>.

To make sure that code generated by different compilers is
interroperable, ARM has created the
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0042a/IHI0042A_aapcs.pdf[ARM
Architecture Procedure Call Standard (AAPCS)]. The register to be used
as the stack pointer and the direction in which the stack grows is all
dictated by the AAPCS. According to the AAPCS, *register `r13`* is to
be used as the stack pointer. Also the stack should be
*full-descending*.

One way of placing global variables and the stack is shown in the
following diagram.

.Stack Placement
image::stack.png[]

So all that has to be done in the startup code is to point `r13` at
the highest RAM address, so that the stack can grow downwards (towards
lower addresses). For the `connex` board this can be acheived using
the following ARM instruction.

------
	ldr sp, =0xA4000000
------

Note that the the assembler provides an alias `sp` for the `r13`
register.

NOTE: The address `0xA4000000` itself does not correspond to RAM. The
RAM ends at `0xA3FFFFFF`. But that is OK, since the stack is
*full*-descending, during the first push the stack pointer will be
decremented first and the value will be stored.

Global Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When C code is compiled, the compiler places initialized global
variables in the `.data` section. So just as with the assembly, the
`.data` has to be copied from Flash to RAM.

The C language guarantees that all uninitialized global variables will
be initialized to zero. When C programs are compiled, a separate
section called `.bss` is used for uninitialized variables. Since the
value of these variables are all zeroes to start with, they do not
have to be stored in Flash. Before transferring control to C code, the
memory locations corresponding to these variables have to be
initialized to zero.

Read-only Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GCC places global variables marked as `const` in a separate section,
called `.rodata`. The `.rodata` is also used for storing string
constants. 

Since contents of `.rodata` section will not be modified, they can be
placed in Flash. The linker script has to modified to accomodate
this. 

Startup Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we know the pre-requisites we can create the linker script
and the startup code. The linker script <<linker2>> is modified to
accomodate the following.

  1. `.bss` section placement 
  2. `vectors` section placement
  3. `.rodata` section placement

The `.bss` is placed right after `.data` section in RAM. Symbols to
locate the start of `.bss` and end of `.bss` are also created in the
linker script. The `.rodata` is placed right after `.text` section in
Flash. The following diagram shows the placement of the various
sections.

.Section Placement
image::csections.png[]

.Linker Script for C code
------
include::code/csum.lds[]
------

The startup code has the following parts

    1. exception vectors
    2. code to copy the `.data` from Flash to RAM
    3. code to zero out the `.bss`
    4. code to setup the stack pointer
    5. branch to main

.C Startup Assembly
[lang="armasm"]
------
include::code/startup.s[]
------

To compile the code, it is not necessary to invoke the assembler,
compiler and linker individually. `gcc` is intelligent enough to do
that for us. 

As promised before, we will compile and execute the C code shown
in <<csum>>.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc -nostdlib -o csum.elf -T csum.lds csum.c startup.s
------

The `-nostdlib` option is used to specify that the standard C library
should not be linked in. A little extra care has to be taken when the
C library is linked in. This is discussed in <<c-library>>.

A dump of the symbol table will give a better picture of how things
have been placed in memory.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-nm -n csum.elf

a0000018 A ram_edata
a0000018 A sbss
a0000018 b sum		<5>
a000001c A ebss
------
<1> `reset` and the rest of the exception vectors are placed starting from `0x0`.

<2> The assembly code is placed right after the 8 exception vectors
    (`8 * 4 = 32 = 0x20`).

<3> The read-only data `n`, is placed in Flash after the code.

<4> The initialized data `arr`, an array of 6 integers, is placed at
    the start of RAM `0xA0000000`.

<5> The uninitialized data `sum` is placed after the array of 6
    integers. (`6 * 4 = 24 = 0x18`)

To execute the program, convert the program to `.bin` format, execute
in Qemu, and dump the `sum` variable located at `0xA0000018`.

------
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary csum.elf csum.bin

[[arm-prog-model]]
Appendix A: ARM Programmer's Model
----------------------------------

A simplified ARM programmer's model is provided in this section.

.Register File

In the ARM processor, 16 general purpose registers are available at
any time. Each register is 32-bit in size. The registers are referred
to as `rn`, where n represents the register index. All instructions
treat registers `r0` to `r13` equally. Any operation that can be
performed on `r0` can be performed equally well on registers `r1` to
`r13`. But `r14` and `r15` are assigned special functions by the
processor. `r15` is the program counter, and contains the address of
the next instruction to be fetched. `r14` is the link register, and
used to store the return address, when a subroutine is invoked.

TIP: Though register `r13` has no special function assigned to by the
processor, conventionally operating systems use it as the stack
pointer, and thus points to the top of the stack.

.Current Program Status Register

The Current Program Status Register (`cpsr`) is a dedicated 32-bit
register, that contains the following fields.

    . Condition Flags
    . Interrupt Masks
    . Processor Mode
    . Processor State

Only the condition flags field will be used in the examples provided
in this tutorial. And hence only the condition flags will be
elaborated here.

The condition flags indicates the various conditions that occur while
performing arithmetic and logical operations. The various condition
flags and their meaning are given in the following table.

.Condition Flags
`--------------`-----------------------------
Flag           Meaning
---------------------------------------------
Carry `C`      Operation caused a carry.
Overflow `O`   Operation caused an overflow.
Zero `Z`       Operation resulted in 0.
Negative `N`   Operation resulted in a negative value.
---------------------------------------------

[[arm-iset]]
Appendix B: ARM Instruction Set
-------------------------------

The ARM processor has a powerful instruction set. But only a subset
required to understand the examples in this tutorial will be discussed
here.

The ARM has a load store architecture, meaning that all arithmetic and
logical instructions take only register operands. They cannot directly
operate on operands to memory. Separate instruction load and store
instructions are used for moving data between registers and memory.

In this section, the following class of instructions will be
elaborated

  1. Data Processing Instructions
  2. Branch Instructions
  3. Load Store Instructions

.Data Processing Instructions

The most common data processing instructions are listed in the
following table.

.Data Processing Instructions
`---------------`---------------`----------------`-----------------
Instruction     Operation       Example		
--------------------------------------------------------------------
`mov rd, n`     `rd = n`        `mov r7, r5`     `; r7 = r5`
`add rd, rn, n` `rd = rn + n`   `add r0, r0, #1` `; r0 = r0 + 1`
`sub rd, rn, n` `rd = rn - n`   `sub r0, r2, r1` `; r0 = r2 + r1`
`cmp rn, n`     `rn - n`        `cmp r1, r2`     `; r1 - r2`
--------------------------------------------------------------------

By default data processing instructions *do not* update the condition
flags. Instructions will update condition flags if it is suffixed with
an `S`. For example, the following instruction adds two registers and
updates the condition flags.

------
adds r0, r1, r2
------

One exception to this rule is the `cmp` instruction. Since the only
purpose of the `cmp` instruction is to set condition flags, it does
not require the `s` suffix, for setting flags.

.Branch Instructions

The branch instructions cause the processor to execute instructions
from a different address. Two branch instruction are available - `b`
and `bl`. The `bl` instruction in addition to branching, also stores
the return address in the `lr` register, and hence can be used for
sub-routine invocation. The instruction syntax is given below.

------
b label        ; pc = label
bl label       ; pc = label, lr = addr of next instruction
------

To return from the subroutine, the `mov` instruction can be used as
shown below.

------
mov pc, lr
------

.Conditional Execution

Most other instruction sets allow conditional execution of branch
instructions, based on the state of the condition flags. In ARM,
almost all instructions have can be conditionally executed.

If corresponding condition is true, the instruction is executed. If
the condition is false, the instruction is turned into a `nop`. The
condition is specified by suffixing the instruction with a condition
code mnemonic.

`-----------------`-------------------------------
Mnemonic          Condition
--------------------------------------------------
EQ		  Equal
NE		  Not Equal
CS		  Carry Set
CC		  Carry Clear
VC		  Overflow Clear
VS		  Overflow Set
PL		  Positive
MI		  Minus
HI		  Higher Than
HS		  Higher or Same
LO		  Lower Than
LS		  Lower or Same
GT		  Greater Than
GE		  Greater Than or Equal
LT		  Less Than
LE		  Less Than or Equal
--------------------------------------------------

In the following example, the instruction moves `r1` to `r0` only if
carry is set.

------
MOVCS r0, r1
------

.Load Store Instructions

The load store instruction can be used to move single data item
between register and memory. The instruction syntax is given below.

------
ldr   rd, addressing    ; rd = mem32[addr]
str   rd, addressing    ; mem32[addr] = rd
ldrb  rd, addressing    ; rd = mem8[addr]
strb  rd, addressing    ; mem8[addr] = rd
------

The `addressing` is formed from two parts

  * base register
  * offset

The base register can be any general purpose register. The offset and
base register can interact in 3 different ways.

Offset::
The offset is added or subtracted from the base register to form the
address. `ldr` Syntax: `ldr rd, [rm, offset]`

Pre-indexed::
The offset is added or subtracted from the base register to form the
address, and the address is written back to the base register. `ldr`
Syntax `ldr rd, [rm, offset]!`

Post-indexed::
The base register contains the address to be accessed, and the offset
is added or subtracted from the address and stored in the base
register. `ldr` Syntax `ldr rd, [rm], offset`

The offset can be in the following formats

Immediate:: 
Offset is an unsigned number, that can be added or subtracted from the
base register. Useful for accessing structure members, local variables
in the stack. Immediate values start with a `#`.

Register::
Offset is an unsigned value in a general purpose register, that can be a
added or subtracted from the base register. Useful for accessing array
elements.

Some examples of load store instructions are given below.

------
ldr  r1, [r0]              ; same as ldr r1, [r0, #0], r1 = mem32[r0]
ldr  r8, [r3, #4]          ; r8 = mem32[r3 + 4]
ldr  r12, [r13, #-4]       ; r12 = mem32[r13 - 4]
strb r10, [r7, -r4]        ; mem8[r7 - r4] = r10
strb r7, [r6, #-1]!        ; mem8[r6 - 1] = r7, r6 = r6 - 1
str  r2, [r5], #8          ; mem32[r5] = r2, r5 = r5 + 8
------

[[arm-stacks]]
Appendix C: ARM Stacks
----------------------

Stacks are highly flexible in the ARM architecture, since the
implementation is completely left to the software.

.Stack Instructions

The ARM instruction set does not contain any stack specific
instructions like `push` and `pop`. The instruction set also does not
enforce in anyway the use of a stack. Push and pop operations are
performed by memory access instructions, with auto-increment
addressing modes.

.Stack Pointer

The stack pointer is a register that points to the top of the
stack. In the ARM processor, there are no dedicated stack pointer
registers, and any one of the general purpose registers can be used as
the stack pointer.

.Stack Types

Since it is left to the software to implement a stack, different
implemenation choices result different types of stacks. There are two
types of stack depending on how the stack grows.

Ascending stack:: In a push the stack pointer is incremented, i.e the
stack grows towards higher address.

Descending stack:: In a push the stack pointer is decremented, i.e the
stack grows towards lower address.

There are two types of stack depending on what the stack pointer
points to.

Empty stack:: Stack pointer points to the location in which the next
item will be stored. A push will store the value, and increment the
stack pointer. 

Full stack:: Stack pointer points to the location in which the last
item was stored. A push will increment the stack pointer and store the
value.

Four different stacks are possible - full-ascending, full-descending,
